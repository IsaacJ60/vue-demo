      <h1>Hi, I'm Rick</h1>
      <p>
        Growing up, I was always fascinated by problem-solving.
        That passion gradually led me to the world of programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Grade 12, I realized how powerful programming can be —
        how it can solve problems and even change the world.
        Since then, I've committed to learning deeply, working hard, and
        building cool projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        With curiosity and determination, I believe we can build solutions that make
        a real impact. I'm especially grateful for the chance to pursue an AI developer role, and I’m
        ready to give my full effort to be part of that journey.
